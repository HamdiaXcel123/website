            <h3>What is Sobolo</h3><br>
            <p>Sobolo is a hibiscus drink made from Hibscus/Roselle petals, not to be confused with hibiscus tea.
             The hibiscus used for this drink is said to be indigenous to West and East Africa. Different cultures make this drink very differently. Even in West Africa there is quite some regional diversity. I have seen Zobo that is made with cloves, pineapple (peel and fruit), ginger and cloves. In Ghana, we pack in the spices ( I mean this is nothing new because we Ghanaians love heat). Our sobolo can include ginger, pineaple (peel, fruit and leaves from the crown), ginger, cloves, dried chilis (yes you heard that right), black peppercorn, grains of paradise (gives a kick), grains of selim and calabash nutmeg. Yes it is a lot but it makes it very distinct. I have seen other variations of what I have detailed in different West African countries, and I have seen recipes that are as simple as the hibiscus petals, steeped in hot water with sugar and maybe oranges. Every person adds their own flair to it
             </p><br>
            <h3>What you will need to make sobolo</h3><br>
            <p>As you have seen from the description of this drink, there is a lot of variations. I find that the Ghanaian version has a lot of ingredients, many of which add a nice taste, but can always be switched around or removed. Its all about what you have available and what you like.</p>
            <ul><br>
                <li><strong>Hibiscus/ Sorrel Flowers:</strong> This red flower is the most important part of the recipe. It is full of colour and has a sour flavour. You can find it at many Caribbean and African stores. NOTE: hibiscus tea you get in tea bag are not going to work. These are completely different from the sorrel.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Added Fruit:</strong> Traditionally, pineapple (the fruit and skins) are used to add sweetness and extra antioxidants, but feel free to use oranges,lemon or any fruit of choice
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Ghanaian sobolo tends to use a lot of spices compared to our other West African counterparts. The spices serve not only as flavour but also a ton of medicinal properties. These spices include grains of Selim, grains of paradise, African bird eye chilli and many more.</li>

                <li><strong>Sweetner:</strong> I tend to use sugar for my drink since hibiscus can be sour, but to cut down on sugar, I include a handful of medjool dates. They are incredibly sweet but with added fibre and nutrients, they are actually a good source of sugar and also ,you can use Honey as your sweetner</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Medicinal Properties</h3>
            <ul>
               <li> Pineapple peels are known to be high in bromelain, a protein digesting enzyme that is great in improving digestion</li>
               <li>Pineapple as a fruit is high in vitamin C, which is a key factor in immune cell function</li>
               <li>Grains of Selim have been used to ease sore throat, at least my mum forces me to chew it when I have a cold, but I do not know if there are any scientific facts out there.</li>
               <li>Ginger is celebrated for its anti-inflammatory process and aid in digestion</li>
               <li>Spices are also medicinal: cloves have been touted to support liver health</li>
                After reading of all the benefits, I was really thinking, so now I can have my cake and eat it too. Its tasty and great for me. Sign me up>

            <h3>How to make Sobolo</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Clean</strong>: You will need to clean the pineapple by soaking a vinegar and water solution to make sure it is clean. Fill up the sink with water and add a few splashes of vinegar</li><br>
                <li><strong>Prep Ingredients</strong>: This is where the most work is done. Peel off the skin, pluck a few of the leaves from the crown and chop up the pineapple fruit into cubes. Peel the ginger and grind or blend with cloves</li><br>
                <li><strong>Blend</strong>: Blend the pineapple, ginger and cloves till smooth</li><br>
                <li><strong>Boil Drink</strong> In a large pot, combine all the ingredient in water and let it come to a boil. Once it has boiled, add the hibiscus leaves and let is steep at a rolling boil for 30 minutes</li><br>
                <li><strong>Cool</strong> After the 30 minutes, turn off the heat, add your sugar or honey to taste (adding in bits till desired sweetness) and let the drink completely cool</li><br>
                <li><strong>Strain</strong> Once the drink has completely cooled, you will need to strain out the liquid with a fine mesh strainer. Use clean hands and do not be afraid to get your hands in there and squeeze out the liquid from the fruits sitting in the drink.</li><br>
              <p>This drink really only requires some chopping here and there, it really is something that can be made while multitasking and can be done right before sleep and left overnight to cool.</p><br>
            </ol>
